To create a README.md for your script, I will first need to review the `main.py` Python script to understand its functionality, features, and how it is intended to be used. This will allow me to provide accurate information in the README file, including a description, installation instructions, usage examples, and any dependencies.

After reviewing the Python script, I will also take a brief look at the `index.html` file to see if it is related to the Python script and should be mentioned or described in the README.

Let's start by examining the `main.py` Python script to understand its purpose and functionalities. Then, I'll proceed to outline a README.md that you can use on GitHub.

### Reviewing the Python Script

I'll start with `main.py`. Please wait a moment while I analyze its content.

Based on the analysis of the `main.py` script, here's a draft for a README.md that you can use for your GitHub repository. This README includes sections for a brief description, installation instructions, usage examples, and any dependencies. Adjust and expand upon this template as necessary to fit the specifics of your project and any additional features or details you wish to include.

# OpenAI Playground Flask App

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to generate code snippets using OpenAI's GPT-4 API. It allows users to input a prompt and a programming language, and returns a code snippet generated by GPT-4 that matches the input criteria.

## Features

- Generate code snippets using GPT-4 based on user input.
- Supports specifying the programming language for the code snippet.
- Utilizes Flask for a simple web interface.

## Installation

Before installing, ensure you have Python 3.6+ and pip installed.

1. Clone this repository.
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Start the Flask app.
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5005/`.
3. Enter a prompt and select a programming language.
4. Submit the form to receive a generated code snippet.

## API Key Configuration

This application requires an OpenAI API key. Place your API key in a file named `api_key.txt` in the root directory of the project.

## Dependencies

- Flask
- openai-python
- markdown

Ensure you have an OpenAI API key to use the GPT-4 features.
